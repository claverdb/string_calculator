PHP 8 testing base

Run: composer install

# Description
```
This program is contained in StringCalculator.php. The main function
of it is 'add', and it allows you to make a string with numbers separated
by different delimiters that they can be given by the user.

We also can see that we have 3 other functions:
- find_unexpected_operation
- find_unexpected_number
- check_errors

If we check the code, we can see that the functionality
of find_unexpected_operation and find_unexpected_number is quite similar.
I haven't match them because it would make the code harder
to understand and it gets cleaner this way.
